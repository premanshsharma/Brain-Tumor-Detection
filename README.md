## Overview
Brain Tumor Detection is a project that focuses on the identification and classification of brain tumors using image processing and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a combination of image resizing, feature extraction algorithms (HoG, SIFT, ORB), thresholding, connected component analysis, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernel functions (linear, poly, sigmoid), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression with various solvers (lbfgs, liblinear, newton-cg), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with k values ranging from 1 to 5. Additionally, deep learning architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, and Inception V3 are used to enhance the detection accuracy. The performance of the machine learning algorithms is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation with k set to 3, ensuring reliable and robust model assessment.
